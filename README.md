# Elections-minimization
Estimating the minimum percentage of the US population which could elect a president. Full details in the "Case US Elections" xlsx file.

The data file contains:
- population per state
- electoral college seats per state

The answer that, to get 50%+1 of the electoral college seats (270), it'd take _at minimum_ ~44% of the US population, or 134,737,835 (with some assumptions, e.g. everybody votes and only 2 candidates).
